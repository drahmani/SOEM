# Self Organizing Eigenspace Map

Here we introduce a novel embedding clustering algorithm based on the self organizing feature  map  which  seeks  to  separate  time  series  based  on  their  singular spectrum analysis  covariance structures.  The method is called Self-Organizing Eigenspace Map (SOEM). It is shown empirically that the consequent clustering produces superior forecasts and the mapping is topologically ordered. The datasets can be downloaded from UCR time series repositery. To run the code you sould first download joint diagonalisation code form  http://bsp.teithe.gr/members/downloads/JointDiagonalization.html install it in a folder called /JnS-1.2 where is the base directory. Second you can run load_UCR_data.m to append training and test data sets. Last Main.m file gives you grid location of clustered time series.
